			 research areas concerned with sequential data, such as text,
			 audio, and video. However, RNNs consisting of sigma cells or tanh
			 cells are unable to learn the relevant information of input data
			 when the input gap is large. By introducing gate functions into
			 the cell structure, the long short-term memory (LSTM) could handle
			 the problem of long-term dependencies well. Since its
			 introduction, almost all the exciting results based on RNNs have
			 been achieved by the LSTM. The LSTM has become the focus of deep
			 learning. We review the LSTM cell and its variants to explore the
			 learning capacity of the LSTM cell. Furthermore, the LSTM networks
			 are divided into two broad categories: LSTM-dominated networks and
			 integrated LSTM networks. In addition, their various applications
			 are discussed. Finally, future research directions are presented
			 for LSTM networks.}",

	abstract   = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by
				  recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because
				  of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review
				  Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by
				  introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long
				  short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does
				  not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess
				  of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow
				  through constant error carousels within special units.
				  Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the
				  constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its
				  computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our
				  experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed,
				  real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons
				  with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time,
				  recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence
				  chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns
				  much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag
				  tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network
				  algorithms.},
